We are VEX Robotics Competition Team from St Peter's College, Palmerston North, New Zealand. Here you will find all of our code from previous seasons, as well as CAD files for our robot. Unfortunatley, we won't be releasing any files for the current season, due to doing so decreasing our team's competitive advantage.
